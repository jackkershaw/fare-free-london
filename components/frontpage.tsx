      <p>
        Campaign for free public transport in London. Our organisation
        brings together community groups, trade unions,
        environmentalists and others who see free public transport as
        central to our vision of london in which we want to live.
      </p>
      <h2>What We Stand For</h2>
      <h3>Opens the City To All</h3>
      <p>
        It is provided as a public service, just like health, education
        and public parks, and is supported by public investment. It is
        central to a vision of London as a city where people, their
        health and the lives they live, come first.
      </p>
      <h3>Socially Just</h3>
      <p>
        Free public transport is socially just, supporting the
        lowest-income families that are least likely to have a car. It
        is better transport, underpinned by substantial investment,
        with a secure, properly-rewarded workforce. It is one of the
        drastic, demonstrative actions needed to tackle climate change
        globally and air pollution locally.
      </p>
      <h3>Model exists in 100+ cities globally</h3>
      <p>
        Public transport is already free in many smaller cities,
        including Luxemburg, Tallinn (Estonia), Montpellier and
        Dunkerque (France) and Albuquerque and Kansas City (USA).
        London can be the first big global city to follow their
        example.
      </p>
      <p>
        We call on the Mayor and the Greater London Authority (GLA) to
        provide free public transport in London. The first step is to
        research ways to implement it. We call on national government
        to support free public transport in London, and around the
        country. The local government finance rules need to be changed,
        so that local authorities can raise money for it.
