# fare-free-london

Website for the Fare Free London Campaign

## Planning

- Gathered inspo from various sources and collected in this repo and on Are.na.
- Made moodboard in Figma
- Desktop and mobile designs in Figma
- Used [vital signs](https://www.vitalsignsmag.org/) as a base for getting going with the site. I decided I wanted to use NextJS with a Wordpress backend again and use [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/) as the API.
- finished figma sketches, decided fonts.

##Â Building

- Edited Vital signs nextjs template.
- Replace template fonts with P22 Underground for the body and Dapifer for the headings.
- Improved the mobile heading by making it fill the screen on opening on mobile. This gives a more polished look and prevents the user clicking in the wrong place.
