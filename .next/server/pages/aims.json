{"pageProps":{"content":"<h1>Aims</h1>\n<p>These are the main aims of the Fare Free London campaign, set up on Saturday, 10 February, at a meeting at the Waterloo Action Centre.</p>\n<p class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\">Free public transport opens the city to all. It is provided as a public service, just like health, </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">education and public parks, and is supported by public investment. It is central to a vision of </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">London as a city where people, their health and the lives they live, come first. </span></p>\n<p class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\">Free public transport is socially just, supporting the lowest-income families that are least </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">likely to have a car. It is better transport, underpinned by substantial investment, with a </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">secure, properly-rewarded workforce. It is one of the drastic, demonstrative actions needed to </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">tackle climate change globally and air pollution locally. </span></p>\n<p class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\">Public transport is already free in many smaller cities, including Luxemburg, Tallinn </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">(Estonia), Montpellier and Dunkerque (France) and Albuquerque and Kansas City (USA). </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">London can be the first big global city to follow their example. </span></p>\n<p class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\">We call on the Mayor and the Greater London Authority (GLA) to provide free public transport in London. The first step is to research ways to implement it. </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">We call on national government to support free public transport in London, and around the </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">country. The local government finance rules need to be changed, so that local authorities can </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">raise money for it.</span></p>\n<h2>Purpose</h2>\n<p class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw PanoWQ\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\">Free public transport will support social justice. A system based on public transport and </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">active travel (walking, cycling and so on) supports Londoners’ physical and mental health. </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">Free public transport, introduced together as part of an integrated transport policy (see “How </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">is it done?”, below), can help rapidly to cut the number of private cars, vans and HGVs on the </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">roads – and so cut greenhouse gas emissions, and the air pollution that kills thousands of </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">Londoners each year. </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">London is falling behind its own weak climate targets, and even further behind targets </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">worked out by climate scientists. The transport sector has made the least progress in cutting </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">fossil fuel use over the last twenty years. Free public transport could start to reverse this </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">dangerous trend. </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">Free public transport cuts across the dangerous populist rhetoric that tackling climate change </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">costs ordinary people money. It shows that the opposite is true: measures to deal with climate </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">change and air pollution can also make life better.</span></p>\n<h2>How is it done?</h2>\n<p class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\">Transport for London (TfL) already provides free transport for over-60s, under-10s and many </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">teenagers, and other discounts. Extending these schemes, using the Oyster card, would </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">present few practical problems. </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">To reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, free public transport will be most </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">effective if implemented as part of an integrated approach that also includes:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\">Providing transport as a public service, not a commodity sold for profit, and expanding </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">services, starting by reversing bus service cuts. Investing heavily in public transport and </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">active travel, which will provide many thousands of new jobs.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\"> Making public transport Londoners’ first choice for getting around: making it enjoyable. Better transport or free transport is a false choice: we can have both. This means investing in </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">safety and staffing; improving accessibility; and making full use of the river Thames as a key to London’s transport system.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\">Supporting a stable workforce with fair pay and conditions, and union organisation. This is </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">the key to a good service. The unions, supported by transport and disability campaign groups, </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">showed this recently, by their success in ditching plans to close rail ticket offices.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\">Reversing decades of national and local government support and subsidies for motor </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">traffic, at the public’s expense. This could include smart road charging (currently under discussion at the GLA); smart emissions-based parking charges; repurposing the Silvertown Tunnel for non-motor traffic; and expansion of school streets and other measures to reclaim street space for communities.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\"> Linking free public transport to cheap or free train travel in the south east, provided by </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">publicly owned companies.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\"> Reorganising and investing in the health service and other public services to make them </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">more accessible and reduce the need for car travel.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\">Implement planning policies and incentives to enable people to lead healthy and fulfilling </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">lives without having to own a car.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\">How would it be paid for?</span></h2>\n<p class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\">Revenue from fares comprises a much higher share of income for TfL than for most big-city </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">transport systems. TfL also receives revenue from business rates retention, other operating </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">income e.g. the congestion charge, and central government grants. </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">TfL policy is to reduce the share of revenue from fares. We agree with this, but call for a </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">much more ambitious reduction, with a target of zero. </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">There is a wide range of options for funding free public transport, set out in detail in our </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">campaign briefing. These include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\">Revenue raised by local government, including land value capture (e.g. the Community </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">Infrastructure Levy used to fund the Elizabeth Line); and road use and parking charges.</span></li>\n<li class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\">Revenue raised by local government that, in the UK, would require a change in local </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">government funding rules, e.g. a payroll tax (used to fund public transport in Paris).</span></li>\n<li class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\">Revenue raised by central government, e.g. increased fuel duty to restore value lost during </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">the 13-year freeze; and a review of road projects to ensure compatibility with climate and </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">other policies, following the Welsh government’s example, with funds diverted to public </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">transport. Wealth taxes and measures against corporate tax evasion could raise much larger </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">sums for public services, including transport.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>London and National Policy</h2>\n<div>\n<div class=\"DF_utQ _0xkaeQ\">\n<div class=\"aF9o6Q _0yZ6Qg\">\n<div class=\"AdBbhQ hGbcYA _7rUwsA\">\n<p class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\">We favour free public transport nationally, based on public need. We will work together with </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">all to achieve it. We welcome cooperation with other campaign groups. </span><span class=\"OYPEnA\">Conservative politicians try to divide voters by claiming that London has an outsize share of national resources. They have used negotiations with the Mayor’s office to try to force a heavier burden on passengers (with higher fares) and staff (by constraining pay increases and undermining pension conditions). We reject this divisive politics.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>List of Groups Who Support Us</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Green Jobs Alliance</li>\n<li>Stop the Silvertown Tunnel coalition</li>\n<li>Tipping Point</li>\n<li>RMT Bakerloo line branch</li>\n<li>RMT London Transport Regional Council</li>\n<li>RMT Central Line East branch</li>\n<li>More to come soon!</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"AdBbhQ hGbcYA rLWGlw _7rUwsA\">\n<p class=\"cgHgbA nxe3IQ Xp24Nw\"><span class=\"OYPEnA\"><a href=\"mailto:info@farefreelondon.org\">Comments and feedback welcome</a>.
